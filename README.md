- ⚡ I love Jesus, my wife, and my 2-yr-old a ton. I'm changing careers at 30 after 9 years teaching because I want to push myself past teaching AP Calculus. I'm excited to tell my son one day about this big risk that I took in 2022. I enjoy gardening, camping, building, guitar, Atlanta Braves baseball, and a good night of pub trivia :beers:
